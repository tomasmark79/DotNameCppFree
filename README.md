# What is the DotName C++ Template?

The DotName C++ Template is a modern and versatile foundation for cross-platform C++ development. It is designed to support both standalone applications and libraries, offering a robust infrastructure that incorporates best practices and tools commonly used in professional software development. 

The **Free üöÄ Edition** provides essential C++ source code and configuration settings to ensure a successful project build. For those seeking enhanced functionality, the **Private üõ∏ Edition** includes advanced features tailored for Visual Studio Code, enabling a highly efficient and comfortable development experience. 

This template is provided "as is," without any guarantees regarding its functionality.

## This solution is a hidden gem waiting to be polished üíé‚ú®

**Why does this exist when there are official CMake extensions for VSCode?**  
Great question. While official extensions are helpful, creating and building an application for architecture **X86** targeting, for example, **Arch64**, requires more than just the basics. You need to provide a toolchain, a minimal system file tree (sysroot), and integrate everything into a functional whole. That‚Äôs precisely what this solution does. üòé - Essentially, all you need to do is supply the toolchain and sysroot, and this solution is ready to produce applications for other platforms.

**What scenarios is this template suitable for?**  
This solution is suitable for a wide range of projects of varying sizes. Thanks to its versatility, it can be used either as a standalone application or for creating modules and libraries for other applications. The solution is designed to adapt to different needs throughout the development cycle. Significant attention and effort have been devoted to finding a balance between optimization, clarity, and the potential for future code flexibility.

**What makes this solution unique?**  
This project combines several modern and unique features. First, the design of the project as a standalone application/library allows the project you are working on to later be used as a component in another project. This, of course, assumes that the main functionality of the application is properly implemented in the library part, while the standalone part can be used, for example, as a starting point for testing the library or simply as a launcher with minimal dependencies on the library. Second, the uniqueness of this solution lies in the fact that the Private version effectively transforms into a professional development IDE thanks to extended tasks in VSCode, making development highly enjoyable.

**Why are CPM.cmake, CPMLicenses, and PackageProject used in this solution?**  
Conan sometimes reacts more slowly to the development of certain projects, while CPM.cmake allows for conveniently using the latest iterations directly from GitHub. Many modern CMake projects use CPM.cmake for dependency management due to its flexibility and efficiency.

**How do you work with this solution?**  
Once I select the operating system, it is essential to have a minimal development environment in place, including binary tools, compilers, linkers, and so on. If we are planning for cross-platform development, we will also need toolchains for cross-compilation. Once everything is set up, I proceed to define Conan system profiles and integrate these profiles into the VSCode task system, ensuring they are ready for everyday use.

I usually start by cloning a fresh copy into my local repository. Then, I launch VSCode and rename in the integrated terminal the standalone and library components to best reflect the project's needs. Next, I focus on defining Conan dependencies or look for dependencies that can be resolved directly using CMake, CPM.cmake, or FetchContent. Once I ensure that the necessary dependencies are either installed on the system or managed by the aforementioned tools, I proceed with a clean build to verify that everything works as expected. After that, it‚Äôs just about the development process itself. Thanks to the careful attention paid to the CMake configuration during the creation of this solution, the configuration process is now highly intuitive.

**What is the future direction of this solution?**  
While this solution could be endlessly improved, such efforts require significant time and dedication. Therefore, its future development will depend solely on my personal needs. Alternatively, it may evolve based on contributions from others who wish to collaborate on the project, request updates, or report bugs that need fixing.

**What is still missing from this solution?**  
The implementation of tests is currently missing. I plan to add them once I decide on a preferred testing framework, which will then be integrated into the solution by default.

## CMake and Conan 2

For smooth operation of the template, tools such as CMake and Conan 2 are required‚Äîideally the latest versions. How you install them is entirely up to you.

To create a new profile, use the following command. More details can be found in the [Conan 2 Documentation](https://docs.conan.io/2/).

```bash
conan profile detect --force
```

[üëÜüèª](#index)

## Building using raw CMake commands

  Using such long commands is unappealing - they make development a tedious and slow ü¶• process. This template was primarily created for use with üé¢ VSCode, where a workflow using tasks triggered by keyboard üéØ shortcuts was developed. However, in some scenarios, this manual process might come in handy.

#### Preparing External Dependencies for Your Project

```bash
conan install "." --output-folder="./build/standalone/default/debug" --deployer=full_deploy --build=missing --profile default --settings build_type=Debug
```

#### Configuration

```bash
source "./build/standalone/default/debug/conanbuild.sh" && cmake -S "./standalone" -B "./build/standalone/default/debug" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="conan_toolchain.cmake" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="./build/installation/default/debug"
```

#### Build target

```bash
source "./build/standalone/default/debug/conanbuild.sh" && cmake --build "./build/standalone/default/debug"  -j 16
```

#### Install target

```bash
source "./build/standalone/default/debug/conanbuild.sh" && cmake --build "./build/standalone/default/debug" --target install -j 16
```

[üëÜüèª](#index)

## Building by CMake Presets

Solution is using Conan, and Conan automatically creates the **CMake*User*Presets.json** and **CMakePreset.json** files. The **CMakePreset** file defines the build configuration for the current folder, while the **CMake*User*Presets** file in the main project folder references all available **CMakePreset** files. Another advantage of these files is that **you can Build all targets at once**, eliminating the need to build each target separately.

you may list all existing CMake presets

```bash
cmake --list-presets
```

example output
```bash
DotNameCppFree on ÓÇ† main [!?] via ‚ñ≥ v3.31.4 via üêç v3.13.1 (env3131) 
‚ùØ cmake --list-presets  
Available configure presets:  

  "conan-debug-x86_64-fa690d22"          - 'conan-debug' config (x86_64-fa690d22)
  "conan-release-x86_64-a7ca6aaa"        - 'conan-release' config (x86_64-a7ca6aaa)
  "conan-minsizerel-x86_64-b9d7b0af"     - 'conan-minsizerel' config (x86_64-b9d7b0af)
  "conan-relwithdebinfo-x86_64-6d462a88" - 'conan-relwithdebinfo' config (x86_64-6d462a88)
  "conan-debug-armv8-8b031f0f"           - 'conan-debug' config (armv8-8b031f0f)
```

you may build only some one or all at once

```bash
cmake --build --preset <preset_name>
# or
./build_all_presets.sh  
```

> üí° The Private edition includes task item üî® Build All CMakeUserPresets.json: **Ctrl+Alt+P** to build all presets on all systems.  

> üí° **conanfile.py** ensures the injection of a uuid into the name value of each CMakePreset.json to prevent the generation of presets with duplicate names.

## Template Structure

```txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/
```
- public header files (.hpp) accessible from others

```txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
```

- source files (.cpp) and header files (.hpp) that are not intended for public use

```txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ standalone/
```
- standalone part of project

```txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
```

All content included in assets folder is accessible via file path by the macro ASSET_PATH. The path to the assets folder is passed to the library through the constructor. ASSET_PATH is generated by CMake.

[üëÜüèª](#index)

## Standalone Source

#### [**cxxopt**](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts/tree/v3.2.1) enables argument management

```bash
DotNameStandalone
Usage:
  ./build/standalone/default/debug/./DotNameStandalone [OPTION...]

  -h, --help      Show help
  -1, --omit      Omit library loading
  -2, --log2file  Log to file
  ```

[üëÜüèª](#index)

## Library Source

The library is connected to the main Standalone project using the CMake CPM.cmake wrapper in Standalone/CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
CPMAddPackage(NAME DotNameLib SOURCE_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/..)
```

[üëÜüèª](#index)

## Reusability in another projects

One of the **advantages** of the chosen design is that the project you are currently working on can later be utilized as a library in another project. üéØ

> üí° Keep in mind that one of the overloaded class constructors of linked libraries may receive the path to the assets folder to enable all classes interested in using the folder's content to access it.

### CMaker Configuration

#### With CPM.cmake

```cmake
CPMAddPackage(
    NAME DotNameCppFree
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY tomasmark79/DotNameCppFreeFree
    GIT_TAG main)

# Remote library source code may require files
# within ./assets folder, then you have to copy
# all of them to your work dir ./assets folder.
file(COPY ${DotNameCppFree_SOURCE_DIR}/assets DESTINATION ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

target_link_libraries(
    ${LIBRARY_NAME}
    PUBLIC dotname::DotNameCppFree
    )
```

#### With CMake FetchContent

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    DotNameCppFree
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/tomasmark79/DotNameCppFreeFree.git
    GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(DotNameCppFree)
file(COPY...
target_link_libraries(...
```

#### With CMake add_subdirectory

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/DotNameCppFreeFree)
file(COPY...
target_link_libraries(...
```

### C++ Implementation

##### In Main.cpp just modify name of the linked library

```cpp
uniqueLib = std::make_unique<dotname::DotNameCppFree> (Config::assetsPath);
```

## Create Lightweight Clone
 
If you are reading this text on a public GitHub repository, it is most likely that this repository was created by the **MakeFreeClone.sh** script located in the **.init/initializers** folder. The script generates a lightweight clone of your main project with the suffix **Free**. For example, **"MyProject"** will become **"MyProjectFree"** and will be automatically kept up to date.

**To Start**

1. Run `MakeFreeClone.sh init` to set up git hooks.

    ```bash
    .init/initializers/MakeFreeClone.sh init
    ```
2. Hooks will sync local and remote free repositories during commit and push.

3. Commits will update `README.md` to add "Free" to relevant strings.

4. Customize exclusions with `--exclude='fileOrFolderEtc'` in the script.

**To stop** maintaining the lightweight clone, we delete the hooks in particular template.

```bash
rm .git/hooks/pre-push
rm .git/hooks/post-commit
```
